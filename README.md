# Module 4 – PyCitySchools with Pandas [School District Analysis]
# Unit Challenge

## Overview of the school district analysis
We have being asked to perform data analysis on a given data set, containing data from different school. The main purpose of analyzing this data is to detect trends in school performance. The analysis we deliver well support the School Board in making decisions about budget and priorities. 

After delivering the initial analysis, we have been informed about the suspicion of academic dishonesty, specifically for the 9th grade in the Thomas High School scores. We will be removing these grades and do the analysis again. We will discover how these changes affect the results of the analysis. 

## Results of the analysis
### 1. How is the district summary affected?
This is a snapshot showing he district analysis before removing the reading and math scores from Thomas High School 9th graders:

and after the removal of the Thomas High School 9th graders grades:
![District summary with no Thomas High Schools 9th graders](/resources/01_after_district_summary.png)

As we can see, the only metric which remain the same is the **average reading score**. All other metrics are reporting a slight decrease. 

### 2. How is the school summary affected?

How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
-	Math and reading scores by grade
-	Scores by school spending
-	Scores by school size
-	Scores by school type
